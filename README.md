# New-York-Green-Cabs-Exploratory-Data-analysis

This project explores Green cab rides in the boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. Data cleaning, scaling, outlier removing operations have been performed. Multiple regression model was built on the data to predict expected fare based on location, time of the ride, etc.

An interactive dashboard was created using Shiny and Leaflet packages to visualize inter borough and intra borough traffic in the New York City
